            All guests will be required to check in at the time of arrival. <br><br>

            1 hour holding period for the reservation. If any of the party did not arrive within the holding time, reservation will be automatically cancelled. <br><br>

            We will be required to collect 50% advance payment for the reservation fee. Remaining 50% will be collected after check out. <br><br>

            Advance payment is non-refundable as we consider your booking SOLD and will not accept future bookings. <br><br>

            Please be advise that rebooking/changing of date and time will be subject to meeting roomâ€™s availability. <br><br>

            Please inform our staff in advance if you want to extend time and/or would like to use the coworking space (charged separately). <br><br>
